[MODAL]----->>>
-We set modal visible: hidden and we use opacity to have a transition.
-We give the modal-background a z-index of 2 and the modal z-index: 5 so its behind.
-We make the div seperately so we can click on it and then the modal will clise you can add a click event or an anchor tag to it
-Putting the modal-background wrapped inside an anchor to click outside the modal and it 
will go back to home page.

to center an absolute div, we put the margin auto, but must have right and left both set to zero.
