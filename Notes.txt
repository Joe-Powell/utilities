[MODAL]----->>>
-We make a background div seperately so we can click on it and then the modal will close, you can add a click event or an anchor tag to it
-We set modal visible: hidden and we use opacity to have a transition.
-We give the modal-background a z-index of 2 and the modal z-index: 5 so its behind.

-Putting the modal-background wrapped inside an anchor to click outside the modal and it 
will go back to home page.

-to center an absolute div, we put the margin auto, but must have right and left both set to zero.
-had to make the body overflow:hidden because it was shaky at the end of the transition

 word-break: break-word;  /* display the overflow on a new line*/



 <<<<<<<<<<<< javaScript >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
    list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
    let mapped = list.map((item) => { item + 1 }) //undefined
    let mapped = list.map((item) => item + 1 ) //234567  wiith no {} it will return automatically.
    let mapped = list.map((item) => { return item + 1 }) // 234567 works because with brackets there must be return keyword.


    forEach vs .map()
    Anytime we wish to perform an action on every item in an array forEach is a great iterator to reach for. 
    The convenience of a callback which can take both a value and an index, along with optional pass-along arguments only adds to its utility.
