[MODAL]----->>>
-We make a background div seperately so we can click on it and then the modal will close, you can add a click event or an anchor tag to it
-We set modal visible: hidden and we use opacity to have a transition.
-We give the modal-background a z-index of 2 and the modal z-index: 5 so its behind.

-Putting the modal-background wrapped inside an anchor to click outside the modal and it 
will go back to home page.

-to center an absolute div, we put the margin auto, but must have right and left both set to zero.
-had to make the body overflow:hidden because it was shaky at the end of the transition
