[MODAL]----->>>
-We set modal visible: hidden and we use opacity to have a transition look nice.
-We give the modal-background a z-index of 2 and the modal z-index: 5 so its behind.
-Putting the modal-background wrapped inside an anchor to clic outside the modal and it 
will go back to home page.

to center an absolute div, we put the margin auto, but must have right and left both set to zero.
